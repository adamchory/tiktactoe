# Tik Tak Toe Exercise
This application allows two players to play a game of Tik Tak Toe.

Click on the square you want to label with an X or an O. If you get 3 tiles diagonal or in a line, you win!

## How to Run?
Download the files to a local folder and run using http-server.

## Roadmap of Future Impovements
Making a tile that has already been clicked on unclickable would be a solid improvement to the current game. Adding a property to track the status of a square either being clicked or not will allow for the board level division to be updated, and disable clicking to that square.
Adding a celebration animation to the webpage when a player wins would be a fun addition. To do this, we would have to incorporate a few images/videos to the file structure and upload it to the virtual DOM when a player wins. This should not be that difficult, for we already have coded when a player wins or not. 
Another addition would be a reset button, rather than refreshing the page to get a new game.
